"""Target rule values — `TargetRules`.

Plan reference: ``006_Step06_TargetRules_Plan.md`` §2 S06-D1 (+ legacy
``005_Step05_ProgramLayer_Plan.md`` §2 S05-D2 / S05-D3).

`TargetRules` is the **value bundle** the program-admission gates + the
`expand_program` builder depend on — the per-typology knobs that distinguish
an apartment from a hotel from an office.

Step 05 ↔ Step 06 boundary (S05-D2): Step 05 defined the **type** (first
consumer `stage01_program`); Step 06 adds the **values + loading**
(`data/target_rules/<t>.json` + `target.rules_loader` + `TargetAdapter`).

Fields:

- `density_factor` — usable-area fraction of the gross footprint; the area
  gate's capacity is `footprint_area_m2 * density_factor`.
- `min_cardinality` — minimum required count per `Role`. Empty dict = no
  cardinality constraint. Required-only (proto3:D023): only `required=True`
  spaces count toward it (enforced in `stage01_program`, not here).
- `requires_single_floor` — typology forbids multi-floor layouts; the
  multi-floor gate fails when this is set and the building has != 1 floor.
- `cardinality_scope` — `"per_floor"` (apartment default) or `"building"`
  (multi-floor house): the scope `min_cardinality` is checked over (S10-D13).
  A separate axis from `requires_single_floor`.
- `default_min_area_m2` — per-`Role` standard floor area (S06-D1). A **full**
  Role-keyed map. This is the SEED `expand_program` reads to fill a fresh
  `SpaceUnitSpec.area_min_m2`; it is **not** a stage01 None-fallback (S05-D1
  stands — stage01 never fills, and a directly-built spec must supply its own
  required `area_min_m2`). Full map (every `Role`, incl. `corridor`) so
  `expand_program[role]` cannot KeyError at runtime — the loader/constructor
  fails loud instead.

The `dict` fields are mutable despite the frozen dataclass (S05-D3 option 가):
kept as plain `dict`s for consistency with the other schema containers
(`ProgramRequest.floor_programs`, `ShapeInput.floors`); the pipeline does not
mutate inputs. Tightening every container to an immutable type is a separate
cross-cutting concern.

# unsatisfiable by construction; reject it as a rule-authoring mistake rather
# than letting it silently make a whole typology infeasible (review 4.8).
